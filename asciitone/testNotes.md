There are several known issues and things to note:

-   The repeat functions are somewhat tempo dependant. If the tempo is too high or too low, repeats may not be heard
-   The lfo is uni-polar and only connects to the filter right now. This means that the filter cutoff must be relatively low in order to hear the lfo doing its thing
-   You may the volume get slightly louder and then quiet again when the waveforms are set to anything but sine. I'm not sure why, so just consider it a quirk
-   The FX page is just getting started. the delay works but you'll see that the GUI gets messed up when on this page.
