Welcome to ascii-tone, a web based FM Synth and step sequencer with a completely ascii-text based graphical user interface. All visual elements are made up of plain text characters.

This project is in the early development period and there are a lot of features planned. I am a relatively new developer and this is my sandbox for learning and experimenting.

ascii-tone runs best on google chrome or mozilla firefox, but will also work with many mobile devices.

See a live demo [here](www.echocoast.net/asciiquencer/index.html)

## About

ascii-tone is inspired by the west coast synthesis paradigm. At its heart, ascii-tone is a 2 operator FM synthesizer routed through a low pass filter to encourage a broad range of tones. It aims to be a unique instrument that is simple and compact.

Specs:

-   2 oscillators with sine, triangle, sawtooth, and square waves
-   2 dedicated Attack - Decay envelopes used for shaping each oscillator's amplitude
-   1 low pass filter with frequency cutoff and resonance parameters
